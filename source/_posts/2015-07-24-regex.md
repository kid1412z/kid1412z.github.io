## Character classes

|Exp.|Match|
|:---|:-----|
|`.`|Matches any character except line breaks. Equivalent to `[^\n\r]`.|
|`\w`|Matches any word character (alphanumeric & underscore). Only matches low-ascii characters (no accented or non-roman characters). Equivalent to `[A-Za-z0-9_]`|
|`\W`|Matches any character that is not a word character (alphanumeric `&` underscore). Equivalent to `[^A-Za-z0-9_]`|
|`\d`|Matches any digit character (0-9). Equivalent to `[0-9]`.|
|`\D`|Matches any character that is not a digit character (0-9). Equivalent to `[^0-9]`.|
|`\s`|Matches any whitespace character (spaces, tabs, line breaks).|
|`\S`|Matches any character that is not a whitespace character (spaces, tabs, line breaks).|
|`[ABC]`|Match any character in the set.|
|`[^ABC]`|Match any character that is not in the set.|
|`a-z`|Matches a character having a character code between the two specified characters inclusive.|

## Anchors

|Exp.|Match|
|:---|:-----|
|`^` |Matches the beginning of the string, or the beginning of a line if the multiline flag (m) is enabled. This matches a position, not a character.|
|`$` |Matches the end of the string, or the end of a line if the multiline flag (m) is enabled. This matches a position, not a character.|
|`\b`|Matches a word boundary position such as whitespace, punctuation, or the start/end of the string. This matches a position, not a character.|
|`\B`|Matches any position that is not a word boundary. This matches a position, not a character.|


## Escape charactors

|Exp.|Match|
|:---|:-----|
|`\.` `\*` `\\` `\+` `\*` `\?` `\{ ` `\(` `\[` |escaped special characters|
|`\t` `\v` `\n` `\r` `\f`|tab, vertical tab, linefeed, carriage return, FORM FEED character (char code 12).|
|`\u00A9`|unicode escaped ©|
|`\000`|Octal escaped character in the form `\000`(null). Value must be less than 255 (`\377`).|
|`\xFF`|Hexadecimal escaped character in the form `\xFF`.|



## Groups and Lookaround

Quantifiers indicate that the preceding token must be matched a certain number of times. By default, quantifiers are greedy, and will match as many characters as possible.
Alternation acts like a boolean OR, matching one sequence or another.

|Exp.|Match|
|:---|:-----|
|(abc) |capture group
|`\1`|Back reference. Matches the results of a previous capture group. For example \1 matches the results of the first capture group `&` \3 matches the third.
|`(?:abc)`|Non-capturing group. Groups multiple tokens together without creating a capture group.|
|`(?=abc)`|Positive lookahead. Matches a group after the main expression without including it in the result.|
|`(?!abc)`|Negative lookahead. Specifies a group that can not match after the main expression (if it matches, the result is discarded).|
|`(?<=ABC)`|Positive lookbehind. Matches a group before the main expression without including it in the result.|
|`(?<!ABC)`|Negative lookbhind. Specifies a group that can not match before the main expression (if it matches, the result is discarded).|

## Quantifiers and Alternation

|Exp.|Match|
|:---|:-----|
|`+` |Matches 1 or more of the preceding token.|
|`*` |Matches 0 or more of the preceding token.|
|`{1,3}` |Quantifier.Matches the specified quantity of the previous token. `{1,3}` will match 1 to 3. `{3}` will match exactly 3. `{3,}` will match 3 or more.|
|`?` |Optional. Matches 0 or 1 of the preceding token, effectively making it optional.|
|`?` |Makes the preceding quantifier lazy, causing it to match as few characters as possible. By default, quantifiers are greedy, and will match as many characters as possible.|

Note:

```
| Acts like a boolean OR. Matches the expression before or after the |.It can operate within a group, or on a whole expression. The patterns will be tested in order.
